The widely-circulated ad, which attempts to solicit money for a supposed investment scheme, appears to use AI-powered deepfake technology. Consumer finance expert Lewis said it was ""weird and pretty frightening"" to have his face and voice imitated. He warned people would be tricked out of money without industry regulation. In the advert - which appeared on Facebook - a fake likeness of Lewis encourages people to sign up for what is claimed to be an Elon Musk-backed project, calling it ""legit"" and a ""great investment"". Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Lewis said: ""My name and face have been the subject of scam adverts for many years, I get countless reports every day. ""This is the first deepfake I've seen with me in itâ¦ it's already difficult enough to persuade people [about scams]. ""I've had friends of mine get in touch with me at times saying 'hey, I've just put some money in that investment scheme you're advertising'. ""I don't advertise, I don't do investment."" Deepfakes are images which have been convincingly digitally manipulated. Experts have long warned they could be used to spread disinformation. The capability to recreate a person's likeness has been around for a number of years, but there are concerns that rapid advancement in machine learning could increase the power and availability of the technology. Asked about the deepfake video of himself, Lewis said: ""I don't think it's perfect but it's the first one and this technology is improving at a rapid speed. ""And frankly, it's disgraceful and people are going to lose money."" He said that regulation of the tech industry amounts to a ""wild west"" situation and called on the government to press ahead with legislation.  Lewis added: ""We are scared of big tech in this country and we need to start regulating them properly. ""Vulnerable people are being scammed and nothing is being done about it."" Lewis sued Facebook in 2018 over fake ads using his name, dropping the legal action after receiving commitments and a Â£3m donation to Citizens Advice from the US firm.

The MoneySavingExpert founder said the video was frightening and urged the government to take immediate action to regulate deepfake media. Here’s what you need to know.  SPONSORED The video uses artificial intelligence to replicate Martin’s face and voice, supposedly to promote an app that is linked with Tesla and Twitter owner Elon Musk. A clip shared to Twitter of the scam shows a deepfake of Mr Lewis next to a picture of Mr Musk. It shows Martin sitting in his office, talking about an investment in something called Quantum AI, which is labelled as Elon Musk’s new project. “Elon Musk presented his new project in which he has already invested more than $3bn (£2.4bn),” the deepfake of Mr Lewis said. “Musk’s new project opens up great investment opportunities for British citizens. No project has ever given such opportunities to residents of the country. “Given the interesting features of the app and, having seen how it works, we think it’s safe to say that the experience is legitimate.” There is a caption which uses lettering similar to the This Morning show, which Martin appears on regularly.  The video first appeared on Facebook but there have been additional reports of it circulating on Instagram.  Martin is warning anyone who sees the video that it is an attempt by criminals to steal their money.  Responding to the video on Twitter, Mr Lewis wrote: “WARNING. THIS IS A SCAM BY CRIMINALS TRYING TO STEAL MONEY. PLS SHARE. “This is frightening, it’s the first deep fake video scam I’ve seen with me in it. Govt & regulators must step up to stop big tech publishing such dangerous fakes. People’ll lose money and it’ll ruin lives.” Speaking to ITV’s Good Morning Britain, Mr Lewis said: “This is a deepfake. I mean they’ve put it together, we’re not quite sure of the exact tech. This is going around on Facebook at the moment and this, as far as I know, is the first deepfake scam advert that we’ve seen. “It’s certainly the first with me in. It’s an absolutely terrifying development. This is still only early stages of the technology and they are only going to get better.” According to the MoneySavingExpert website, if you see the post online being shared by someone, you should let them know it’s a scam and that it is fake.  Plenty of people fall for scams, and Mr Lewis never does adverts or promotes investments.
