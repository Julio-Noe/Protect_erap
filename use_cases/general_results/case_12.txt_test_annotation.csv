0,29,"More importantly, however, the content of the recommendations and predictions has also been criticised for gender insensitivity and sexism: by default, the apps treat women as seeking to get pregnant (Epstein et al., 2017), whereas men are met with the image of a sexually potent macho, who often manages multiple sexual partners and equates good sexual performance with physical fitness and effort (Kroløkke, 2020).",AI Act,performance,http://tair.adaptcentre.ie/ontologies/tair/Performance

0,37,"Moreover, the apps do not disclose how they arrived at specific recommendations (Novotny & Hutchinson, 2019) and this lack of transparency, as well as the overwhelming amount of information supplied by them can further exacerbate negative emotions, such as stress and anxiety, that are already often associated with fertility and menstruation (Costa Figueiredo et al., 2017, 2018).",Data protection,disclose,https://w3id.org/dpv#Disclose
