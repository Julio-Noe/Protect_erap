0,4,Continuous glucose monitors are personal medical devices worn by type 1 diabetic patients in their everyday life.,Ethics,life,http://eaontology.linkeddata.es/def/Life
0,4,"Although they can be used for purely informational purposes similarly to other self-tracking devices, they are commonly coupled with insulin pumps which administer glucose when the blood glucose level of the user reaches a specific threshold.",AI Act,user,http://tair.adaptcentre.ie/ontologies/tair/User
0,4,They take constant readings of blood glucose levels without requiring any involvement of the patient.,Data protection,patient,https://w3id.org/dpv#Patient
0,4,"Additionally, when coupled with insulin pumps, the use of CGM can make diabetes management less invasive and more convenient – patients no longer have to strictly monitor parameters and stick the needles themselves as the process is automated and the insulin is administered by a wearable device that can be concealed under clothes and does not inflict pain.",Data protection,use,https://w3id.org/dpv#Use

0,4,"Moreover, CGM can also be used together with smartphone and other apps in order to provide patients with recommendations relating to their level of activity, diet and general well-being – based on their blood glucose level, a patient could see suggestions to eat or abstain from eating something sweet, engage in more exercise on that day or even contact a doctor.",Data protection,patient,https://w3id.org/dpv#Patient

0,10,"Patient empowerment is also one of the promises, as CGM are supposed to give users greater insight into their condition, bringing both psychological and practical benefits to their lives.",Data protection,patient,https://w3id.org/dpv#Patient
0,10,"Last but not least, the data collected through CGM is sometimes lauded for its potential to change diabetes research and possibly lead to new ways of addressing the illness.",Data protection,data,https://w3id.org/dpv#Data
0,17,"The first set included the terms ‘personal* medic*’, ‘continuous glucose monitor*’ ‘self-track* AND medic*’, and the second included the terms ‘ethic*’, ‘moral*’, ‘virtue*’ and ‘legal*’, and all have been adjusted depending on the search database.",Data protection,monitor,https://w3id.org/dpv#Monitor
0,17,"Moreover, some papers identified general ethical and legal issues and opportunities connected to CGM and served as a basis for inferring aspects connected to personalisation in particular.",Data protection,personalisation,https://w3id.org/dpv#Personalisation
0,20,"Consequently, while it is true that CGM are helpful in the management of diabetes, they could also be seen as putting pressure on patients by requiring them to take more responsibility over their health, and inducing greater or even excessive care for health, potentially overmedicalizing the life of patients or contributing to health-related anxiety (Lupton, 2013b).",Ethics,life,http://eaontology.linkeddata.es/def/Life
0,20,"Although CGM have an undeniable positive impact on the well-being of diabetic patients (Dunn et al., 2018; Zapatka, 2019), some ethical concerns surrounding their use can be identified (Quintal et al., 2019).",Data protection,impact,https://w3id.org/dpv#Impact
0,20,"Although CGM have an undeniable positive impact on the well-being of diabetic patients (Dunn et al., 2018; Zapatka, 2019), some ethical concerns surrounding their use can be identified (Quintal et al., 2019).",Data protection,use,https://w3id.org/dpv#Use
0,20,"As such, it could be argued that the use of CGM and other similar personal medical devices is not merely an option for diabetic patients, but might be seen as the only responsible choice (Crawford, 2004, 2006; Lupton, 2012, 2013a).",Data protection,use,https://w3id.org/dpv#Use
0,20,"Traditional methods of monitoring are inconvenient, more time consuming and not as reliable (Becker, 2017; Zimberoff, 2015) and patients opting not to use CGM could be seen as failing to follow medical advice, similarly as if they opted not to follow the prescribed diet or maintain the recommended level of activity.",Data protection,use,https://w3id.org/dpv#Use
0,20,"Furthermore, the greater accuracy of CGM could mean that patients willing to treat their health “seriously” would be expected or even forced to monitor a greater number of potentially relevant factors and to do so in a greater number of circumstances (Lupton, 2016).",Data protection,monitor,https://w3id.org/dpv#Monitor
0,22,"The great complexity of these devices could also mean that patients will not be fully aware of the CGM’s purpose and will not be able to give informed consent to their use (Klugman et al., 2018).",Data protection,purpose,https://w3id.org/dpv#Purpose
0,22,"Consequently, the use of CGM and their possible negative impact on health perception is an area ripe with ethical issues and some scholars have suggested that it could potentially benefit from increased regulation (Carroll, 2014).",Data protection,use,https://w3id.org/dpv#Use

0,24,The increased use of CGM also impacts the role of medical professionals.,Data protection,use,https://w3id.org/dpv#Use
0,24,"The possibility to remotely monitor the condition of patients might mean that medical professionals will spend more time investigating data in front of computers rather than engaging in direct contact with their patients (Gabriels & Moerenhout, 2018), especially if CGM are used by health providers as a cost-cutting measure (Coughlan, 2006).",Data protection,monitor,https://w3id.org/dpv#Monitor

0,24,"Additionally, the automated management of disease enabled by data-driven medicine might mean that the patients’ needs are not fully addressed and that the autonomy of individuals involved in the treatment might be at risk (Rich & Miah, 2017).",Data protection,data,https://w3id.org/dpv#Data

0,24,"Sharon argues that even if new kinds of relationships and solidarity would develop among patients and practitioners as a result of the use of personal medical devices, it is not certain that this would be to the benefit of everybody involved (Sharon, 2017).",Data protection,use,https://w3id.org/dpv#Use

0,26,"These concerns clearly show that personalised medicine is at risk of becoming excessively impersonal, enforcing generalised norms and prompting the users to engage in self-discipline in order to fit them (Ajana, 2017).",Data protection,risk,https://w3id.org/dpv#Risk
0,26,"Similarly, Piras and Miele note that the money and effort required to self-track for health could mean that patients needing such health interventions the most, might not actually be able to use them (Piras & Miele, 2017).",Data protection,required,https://w3id.org/dpv#Required
